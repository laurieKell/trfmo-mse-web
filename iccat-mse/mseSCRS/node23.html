Swordfish</A>
</H2>

<P>
Assessments for North and South Atlantic swordfish were conducted in 2013. The next assessment is proposed for 2016. 

<P>
For the Mediterranean stock, the last assessment was conducted in 2010. The next assessment should take place during 2014, using data up to 2013 to allow a preliminary evaluation of the imposed management measures after 2008.

<P>
Proposed work

<P>
A list of recommended work has been provided in the Report of the 2013 ICCAT Atlantic Swordfish Stock Assessment Session (SCRS/2013/019). Among those recommendations, the following were identified as high priority areas where continued efforts are required:

<P>
Catch and effort data and reporting deadlines

<P>
All countries catching swordfish (directed or by-catch) should report catch, catch-at-size (by sex) and effort statistics by a small an area as possible, and by month. These data must be reported by the ICCAT deadlines, even when no analytical stock assessment is scheduled. Historical data should also be provided.

<P>
CPUE series

<P>
It is recommended that scientists from Japan, ChineseTaipei, Canada, Spain, Portugal and the United States (North Atlantic) and Japan, ChineseTaipei, Spain, Uruguay and Brazil (South Atlantic), as well as any others CPCs, coordinate their work before the meeting (possibly using videoconference), with the goal of updating the index prior next assessment (or presenting the results as document at 2014 SCRS meeting). Future data preparatory meetings should focus on resolving the conflicting indices to the extent possible prior to the next assessment. Consideration should be given to aggregating the CPUE trends by area (rather than the current method of aggregating by nation). For the South Atlantic in particular, some attempt should be made to use stock assessment methods that can reconcile the contradictory trends in the target and by-catch CPUE series for the south (e.g., age/spatially-structured models).

<P>
Discards

<P>
Information on the number of fish caught, and the numbers discarded (dead and released alive) should be reported in order to quantify discarding in all months and areas so that the effect of discarding and releasing can be fully included in the next stock assessment. These data must be reported by the ICCAT deadlines for submission of Task I and II data.
Target species

<P>
All fleets should record detailed information on log records to quantify which species or species-group is being targeted. Compilation of detailed gear characteristics and fishing strategy information (including time of set) are very strongly recommended in order to improve CPUE standardization.The Group recommended the investigation of alternative forms of analyses in the South Atlantic, that deal with both the By-catch and Target patterns, such as age- and spatially-structured models. Results should be presented as documents at 2014 SCRS meeting.

<P>
Weight-length relationships

<P>
The Group recognized thatthe newly-adopted length-weight relationships for swordfish require validation with new field information. National scientists are requested to collect and submit observed values of length (LJFL) and round weight data to the Secretariat to facilitate this task.
