South Atlantic Swordfish Research Plan</A>
</H3> 

<P>
Given the poor understanding of population dynamics of swordfish in the South Atlantic, the Group should develop a long term plan for an enhanced program of research, focusing on independent estimates of fishing mortality, fraction mature by age, growth by sex and stock, movement and migrations, and improving available indices of abundance. Within the context of the SCRS Strategic Plan, this deficiency could be addressed.

<P>
Environmental effects

<P>
Given the possibility of spatial and environmental effects being partially responsible for the conflicting directions of some of the influential indices of abundance, the Group should further study into this hypothesis during the coming year, use existing PSAT data to compliment this work, and to determine how best to formally including these environmental covariates into the overall assessment process. The United States is willing to take a lead role in this investigation and likely collaborators would include scientist from Canada, Japan, and Spain as their indices were the most appropriate for this work. Moreover, the review of historical size data and fishery data is necessary to decide appropriate modelling structure, which should be conducted by national scientists and the ICCAT Secretariat. Expected deliverables would include quantified reduction in the conflicting indices of abundance from the temperate and tropic regions, which in turn should lead to a more stable assessment. Other products could include an increased understanding of the distribution of Swordfish and perhaps a revisiting of the geographic structure of the data and the assessment. These works should be done before the next stock assessment.

<P>
Informative priors for carrying capacity

<P>
Given the sensitivity of assessment results in general to prior distributions for carrying capacity in situations where the data are uninformative, the group recommends that informative priors for K be developed based upon factors such as habitat area, population density and other life history factors. While borrowing a prior based upon the posterior for K from another assessment, e.g. using the posterior for K from the North for the South may be scientifically justified; the Group recommends that future decisions such as this be based upon scientific analyses similar to the development of a prior for r.
