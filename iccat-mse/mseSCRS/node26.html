Working Group on Stock Assessment Methods</A>
</H2>

<P>
The Working Group discussed the future work plan and retained mainly the following actions:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.</DT>
<DD>WGSAM recommends reviewing the protocols and algorithms for estimating Effort distribution (5x5) for longline (EFFDIS), and extended to purse seine and baitboat gears, currently prepared by the Secretariat. The Working Group should also include estimates of uncertainty on these products. It is suggested that published estimates in the ICCAT Web page, include also detailed description of the estimate assumptions and uncertainty related to these products to make aware the potential users of their limitations.
</DD>
<DT>2.</DT>
<DD>The Commission expects risk-based advice on management measures as prescribed in the Kobe II Strategy Matrix and as embedded in its Decision Framework (Rec. 11-13). An important aspect of providing such scientific advice is adequate quantification of uncertainty in stock condition and future prospects under future management option scenarios. With the advent of more commonly applied, highly parameterized stock assessment models, the computational investment in quantifying uncertainty in stock status and future prospects is quite heavy. This is also the experience at other tRFMOs and a number of approximations for quantifying both process and observational uncertainty are being applied to develop risk-based management advice. Guidance on the evolution of and possibility of harmonizing methods to apply for uncertainty characterization across species groups should be provided by WGSAM.
</DD>
<DT>3.</DT>
<DD>Including during the agenda items of 2014 some of the Horizontal Themes identified during the process of elaborating the SCRS Strategic Plan in 2013, particularly those related to participation and capacity building and quality control of the stock assessments and management advice.
</DD>
<DT>4.</DT>
<DD>WGSAM recognized that there is a trend in recent assessments conducted by the SCRS to use multiple modelling methods to estimate the status of the stock relative to ICCAT conservation benchmarks. While WGSAM agrees the use of multiple approaches is a good practice, situations have arisen where the different methods give results that are not consistent yet equally plausible. Having guidance from the WGSAM on best practices to reconcile or combine such results would be very helpful (see, for example, ICES 2007).
</DD>
<DT>5.</DT>
<DD>The evaluation of Limit Reference Points (LRP) and Harvest Control Rules (HCR) through the  use of Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) is increasingly 
being recognized by global tuna RFMOs as an effective means to advance their fishery management process.
The 2013 assessments of albacore and swordfish were used as examples of how an MSE process could possibly be 
formally included in the management of those stocks.
The WGSAM plans to continue this effort by 

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>(1)</DT>
<DD>continuing to refine the methods within the MSE process, 
</DD>
<DT>(2)</DT>
<DD>introduce MSE more assessments when and where appropriate, and 
</DD>
<DT>(3)</DT>
<DD>foster lines of communication that keep managers informed of their benefits and weaknesses.
