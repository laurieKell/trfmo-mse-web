<P>
Past considerations relevant to the 2014 stock assessment

<P>
Catch and effort

<P>
All countries catching swordfish (directed or by-catch) should report catch, catch-at-size (ideally by sex) and effort statistics by as small an area as possible (2x2 degree rectangles for longline, and 1x1  degree rectangles for other gears), and by month, particularly for the major fleets.
Responsibility:All CPCs;Deadline:one month prior to the meeting.

<P>
Discards

<P>
It is recommended that at least the order of magnitude of unreported catches and discards be estimated by major fleets.
Responsibility:All CPCs;Deadline:one month prior to the meeting.

<P>
CPUE indexes

<P>
The Group notes that it is important to collect size data together with the catch and effort data to provide meaningful CPUEs by biomass and age for the major fleets.
Responsibility:national scientists;Timeframe:15 days prior to the meeting.

<P>
Gear selectivity studies

<P>
Although some work has been already done, further research on gear design and use is encouraged in order to minimize catch of age-0 swordfish and increase yield and spawning biomass per recruit from this fishery.Responsibility:national scientists;Timeframe:15 days prior to the meeting.

<P>
Stock mixing and management boundaries

<P>
Considering differences in the catch and CPUE patterns between different Mediterranean fisheries, further research, including tagging investigations, in defining temporal variations in the spatial distribution pattern of the stock will help to improve stock assessment and management.
Responsibility:national scientists;Timeframe:15 days prior to the meeting.

<P>
Other considerations relevant to the Mediterranean stock assessment

<P>
Alternative Stock Assessment Models

<P>
Results of the previous assessment that was based on XSA were highly dependent on the selection of the plus group. The application of additional methods should be explored based on the trials made during the 2013 assessment of the Atlantic stocks. 
Responsibility:Secretariat and national scientists;Timeframe:during the meeting.

<P>
Participation

<P>
Participation in the Swordfish Species Group has been problematic in recent years. The Group recommends that CPCs that can make valuable contributions to the assessment make the necessary arrangements to ensure the presence of their national scientists at the assessment meeting.
Responsibility:CPCs and national scientists;Timeframe:15 days prior to the meeting.
