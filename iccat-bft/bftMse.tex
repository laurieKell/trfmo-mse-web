\title{GBYP MSE}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

This document summarises work being conducted in relation to the \gls{MSE} tasks identified at the  
\textbf{Meeting on Bluefin Stock Assessment Methods} (Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States July 20 to 22, 2013).

A variety of papers have been written or will be written on \gls{RA} and the MSE.  The objective of this document is to identify and propose collaborative 
papers (SCRS and \textbf{peer-reviewed}) to take this work forward and provide a bibliography.

MSE work being conducted for by the SCRS for other stocks summarised in a separate document.

All software and code will be open source and made available on the \href{http://rscloud.iccat.int}{ICCAT cloud server} to 
allow collaborative working both within the SCRC and between the scientific committees of other \glspl{RFMO}

\subsection{Risk Analysis}

A qualitative Risk Assessment has been conducted with members of the SCRS and the Commission under
Phases II and III; under Phases IV and subsequent phases the intention is to conduct quantitative analyses
to identify the main sources of uncertainty that should be developed as \glspl{OM} and 
then to review the process.

There are a variety of quantitative techniques that could be applied, from the relatively simple (e.g. elasticity and sensitivity analyses)
to complex approaches such as MSE. In the first instance it is intended to use a range of simple techniques to identify scenarios for use in the 
MSE. The approaches will then be reviewed in a peer review paper. 

Various papers peer review papers are being written and planed under the the GBYP, i.e.
papers i) reviewing historical sources of uncertainty considered \citepeer{fromentin2014spectre}
ii) Identification and prioritisation of uncertainties \citepeerInprep{leach2014elicit};
iii) Identification of the major sensitivities \citescrs{kell2014sense}; iv)  
simple methods based on life history relationships \citepeerInprep{kellInprepElas};
vii) a comparison of the relative importance of the values of information and control \citepeerInprep{gbypInprep1}; and 
iv) a review Paper summarising the lessons learnt \citepeerInprep{gbypInprep2}.

\section{Work in Progress}

A variety of tasks were proposed at GBYP Modelling for by year to take the work forward.

\begin{enumerate}[2013]
 \item 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Discussion of alternative mixing structures in broad terms SCRS paper with key contributors. 
%\textbf{[SCRS paper 1]}
\item Clarification of standard inputs to standard separate west/east assessments. Use ICCAT meeting to facilitate with those most familiar with data (Terms of Reference document). Table of information available 
%\textbf{[?]}
\item Clarification on data availability for mixing and stock structure related data for more complex stock assessments. Genetic, microconstituents, tags (archival, conventional, other) 
%\textbf{[SCRS paper 1]}
\item Identification of major sensitivities for both separate and mixed stock assessments (e.g., M, fecundity schedule, SRR and alternative mechanism of population regulation) 
%\textbf{[SCRS paper 1, Peer Review Paper 1, Peer Review Paper 2]}
\item Use Risk assessment paper on qualitative identification of uncertainty (written under GBYP modelling contract) to inform OM scenarios, i.e., SCRS paper with key contributors. 
%\textbf{[Peer Review Paper 1, GBYP Contract I]}
\item Identification of those who will be taking both assessment approaches further forward Consistent, core group over a multi-year timeline 
%\textbf{[?]}
\item Support capacity development for conduct, understanding and use of MSE in adoption of Harvest Control Rules for the Atlantic bluefin fisheries through:
\begin{enumerate}
\item ICES/ICCAT MSE training in (Dec. 2013) to facilitate capacity building for CPC scientific delegations; 
%\textbf{[ICES/ICCAT Training Course]}
\item Take advantage of GEF/FAO Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction Tuna Program funds intended to accelerate the joint tuna RFMO working group for MSE development and management /stakeholder / science (jargon-free) dialogue. 
%\textbf{[wait and see]}
\item Conduct a ‘side event’(SCRS Chairman to co-ordinate) at the 2013 Commission meeting open to CPCs and stakeholder groups, drawing upon the experience at CCSBT to initiate the management / science/ stakeholder dialogue. 
%\textbf{[!]}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\item

For bluefin session
\begin{enumerate}
\item Eastern assessment update 
Post-bluefin; ideally follows bluefin session
\item Review of updated separate assessment approaches
\item Review of initial mixed stock models and refinement of alternative mixing structure scenarios
\item Tool for visualizing movement
\item Meeting including stakeholders (finalise at 2013 Commission meeting)
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
